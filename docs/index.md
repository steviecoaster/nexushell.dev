You've found the online documentation for [NexuShell](https://github.com/steviecoaster/NexuShell)!

NexuShell is a PowerShell module for the [Sonatype Nexus Repository Server](https://www.sonatype.com/products/repository-oss) API. Each function inside of the module links back to its corresponding page here on the docs site.

## What is Sonatype Nexus

Sonatype Nexus is a Repository Server that exists in two flavors. Open Source (Sonatype Nexus OSS), and Pro (Sonatype Nexus Pro). The open-source version of Sonatype Nexus is extremely feature rich, providing you _almost_ all of the functionality of the Pro edition. It only lacks things like Azure Blob Storage availability for use in Blob Stores, High Availability, and Blob Store migrations, and a Support contract.
